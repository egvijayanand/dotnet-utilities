Join me on Developer Thoughts (https://egvijayanand.in/), an exclusive blog for articles on .NET MAUI and Blazor.

What's new in ver. 1.1.0:
-------------------------
1. Introduced an option to support the XML-based solution file (slnx) format.

This would be an explicit option since the SLNX feature is currently in the preview stage and is only supported on VS2022.

-slnx | --use-slnx - Default value is false

dotnet new sourcegen -n XamlAutomation -slnx

2. Introduced the option to include a reference to the PolySharp NuGet package.

-ips | --include-polysharp - Default value is false

dotnet new sourcegen -n XamlAutomation -ips

Note: These options may also be combined.
